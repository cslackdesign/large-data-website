One thing to remember about EFH is that they have strict colour schemes, imagery, and texture patterns to follow. Therefore the amount of wiggle room in the boards was small.

My personal favourite board (and the one I beileve will work the best) is board 2. I feel that it is very sleek and professional which is important to EFH's core values.
