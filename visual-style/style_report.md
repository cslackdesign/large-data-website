# Visual Style Report

##Eastforest homes

One thing to remember about EFH is that they have strict colour schemes, imagery, and texture patterns to follow. Therefore the amount of wiggle room in the boards was small.

My personal favourite board (and the one I beileve will work the best) is board 2. I feel that it is very sleek and professional which is important to EFH's core values.

###Style Board 1

I like the feel of this board as it is fall-themed and also goes with their corporate colours. It does however add colous and styles that may not work with thecompanies values.

###Style Board 2

This board feels the best to me. It includes corporate colours and values while still using good design. It also is incredibly legible (so all users can read).

###Style Board 3

This board is very fun and airy, but is a little less professional. I feel that the company will not like the style.
