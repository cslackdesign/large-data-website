## Observations

- I realized that to properly sort the cards I needed more depicting more exact topics on the site as I think people were confused.
- everyone group large amounts of data together that could possibly have something to do with needing more cards.
- Some of the groupings were unexpected to me (card sort 2)
- Common comments were people trying to understand the uses of the information in my site.
- I felt like I didn't give the sorters enough information to properly sort the cards.
- People often struggled with the Site Maps card and the HR Policies card.
- The groupings were somewhat similar to my expectations and realized that I will have to go more in depth in the amount of topics for the actual sorting of my site.
